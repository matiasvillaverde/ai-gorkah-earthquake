# Damage grade prediciton for buildings afected by the Gorkah Earthquake

An insightful endeavour aimed at predicting building damage from the notorious Gorkha Earthquake in 2015. By leveraging the powerful pairing of XGBoost and Optuna, this project endeavors to not just predict but to understand the relationship between various factors and the extent of damage. Our aim is to build a robust, intuitive model using extensive feature selection, optimization and machine learning techniques.
